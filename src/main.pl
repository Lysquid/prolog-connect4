%%% A Prolog Implementation of Connect4
%%% using the minimax strategy
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

/*

The following conventions are used in this program...

Single letter variables represent:

L - a list
N - a number, position, index, or counter
V - a value (usually a string)
A - an accumulator
H - the head of a list
T - the tail of a list

For this implementation, these single letter variables represent:

P - a player number (1 or 2)
B - the board (a 9 item list representing a 3x3 matrix)
    each "square" on the board can contain one of 3 values: x ,o, or e (for empty)
S - the number of a square on the board (1 - 9)
M - a mark on a square (x or o)
E - the mark used to represent an empty square ('e').
U - the utility value of a board position
R - a random number
D - the depth of the minimax search tree (for outputting utility values, and for debugging)

Variables with a numeric suffix represent a variable based on another variable.
(e.g. B2 is a new board position based on B)

For predicates, the last variable is usually the "return" value.
(e.g. opponent_mark(P,M), returns the opposing mark in variable M)

Predicates with a numeric suffix represent a "nested" predicate.

e.g. myrule2(...) is meant to be called from myrule(...) 
     and myrule3(...) is meant to be called from myrule2(...)


There are only two assertions that are used in this implementation

asserta( board(B) ) - the current board 
asserta( player(P, Type) ) - indicates which players are human/computer.
